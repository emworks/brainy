If that sounds incredibly time-consuming, it is! But Pixar gets help from some mathematical equations.\nLive-action filmmakers make sure that every object in a room or environment is in the right place before they film a scene, and Pixar filmmakers do too, with virtual sets, props, and characters. Practice using geometric transformations to stage your own Pixar scene!\nIf you need to fill a scene with characters – a school of fish, a mob of monsters, or a cast of robots – you need to design a bunch of simple body parts that can be combined in different ways. Try making your own robot from parts – and share it!\nTo get Pixar characters to not look so “computer-y,” artists turn to modeling, creating virtual 3-D shapes on the computer. To smooth those shapes out and make them look even more real, they use a simple algorithm called “subdivision,” and you’ll get to try it, too. \nWhen creating the virtual worlds that their characters live in, technical artists at Pixar look to the natural world for inspiration and mimic it using mathematical formulas. This lesson dives into the math that was used to create the landscapes in \"Brave,\" starting with a single blade of grass. \nWhether it’s hand-drawn or done using a computer, animation always has the same goal: to take a series of images and play them back in a sequence. At Pixar, computers help fill in the gaps in those sequences, using mathematical functions – and you’ll get to try this too, by animating a bouncing ball. \n“Rigging” is what Pixar artists call the process that gives characters movement, and it’s a crucial step in making them more realistic and human (even if they’re not actually humans). In this lesson, you’ll get to use the same toolbox that Pixar uses to animate a desk lamp and make a snowman smile.\nTo make the surfaces of characters or objects seem believable, artists at Pixar take basic patterns and use computer graphics to make those patterns more random. You’ll get to use randomness in this lesson, when you make your very own dinosaur skin!\nPixar effects artists create explosions, fire, and water by breaking them down into millions of tiny particles and controlling them using computer programming. In this lesson, you’ll use basic physics to create mini-special effects like flowing water and exploding fireworks.\nJust as live-action movies are made using cameras, Pixar uses virtual cameras to “film” their movies, with lenses that act like the real thing. In this lesson, you’ll experiment with different camera settings like F-stop, focal length and focus to create cool effects in scenes from “Inside Out.”\nJust as dialog, acting, and music are tools filmmakers use to convey meaning and emotion, color can be used to the same effect. But determining “color” is not as simple as saying “red” or “brown” because there are endless shades of color in the visible spectrum. In this lesson, you will learn how color is determined partly by the physics of light and partly by how our brains perceive it.\nA believable world frequently contains objects that need to move in a realistic way, but are too complicated or numerous to move individually “by hand” - things like leaves on a tree or hairs on a monster’s body. In this lesson, visitors will learn how Pixar uses computer programming to create believable simulated hair as seen in the film Brave.\nWithout virtual lights, animated films would be as dark as a live action movie would be without actual lights.  Pixar’s Lighting Artists use light to support the emotion of the story and make the films look and feel believable. In this lesson you will learn about the properties of light and how different types of light sources are used to bring beauty, depth and emotion to Pixar films.\nThis topic is an exploration of the storytelling process at Pixar. \nOverviews of Pixar in a Box  for students and teachers.\n","lang":1,"url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/sitemaps/partner-content/pixar","title":"Pixar in a Box","sourceId":"Khan Academy"},{"description":"","lang":1,"url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/sitemaps/partner-content/brookings-institution","title":"The Brookings Institution","sourceId":"Khan Academy"},{"description":"","lang":1,"url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/sitemaps/partner-content/lebron-asks-subject","title":"LeBron asks","sourceId":"Khan Academy"},{"description":"","lang":1,"url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/sitemaps/partner-content/mit-k12","title":"MIT+K12","sourceId":"Khan Academy"},{"description":"Are you interested in learning more about what philosophers have said in the past?

Such dynamic processes continually reshape the surface of the Earth. The movement of rigid plates on the Earth’s surface, known as plate tectonics, is the cause of these changes. Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes are dramatic hints of the great movements that take place over the vastness of geological time.\nEvidence collected during the five-year voyage of the HMS Beagle led to Charles Darwin’s revolutionary theory that all species, including humans, adapt to different environments and change over time through the process of natural selection. Since a Neanderthal skullcap was discovered in 1856, thousands more fossils have helped paleoanthropologists piece together the story of our ancient ancestors, from early hominins who lived more than six million years ago to modern Homo sapiens, who evolved 200,000 to 150,000 years ago. In the 1990s, geneticists joined the effort, using DNA to shed light on how modern humans are related to one another and what makes our species unique. These videos and essays cover the evidence for human evolution and how understanding evolutionary biology benefits human health and wellbeing.\nThe Universe is all the matter, energy, and space that exists, and the observable universe is the part that we can see.

Art existed in the context of dramatic events such as industrialization, urbanization, economic upheaval, migrations, and wars. Countries and governments were re-formed; women’s and civil rights’ movements catalyzed social change.\n\nArtists assumed new roles in society. Styles of art proliferated and often gave rise to artistic movements. Art and architecture exhibited a diversity of styles, forming an array of “isms.” Works of art took on new roles and functions in society and were experienced by audiences in new ways. Art of this era often proved challenging for audiences and patrons to immediately understand.\nArtistic traditions of the ancient Near East and dynastic Egypt focused on representing royal figures and divinities and on the function of funerary and palatial complexes within their cultural contexts.

It turns out that the only way to turn one element into another element is using nuclear chemistry! Nuclear reactions change the composition of an atom's nucleus, and this process is useful for many applications. \nChemists are often interested in how fast a reaction will occur, and what we can do to control the rate. The study of reaction rates is called kinetics, and we will learn about average reaction rate, rate laws, the Arrhenius equation, reaction mechanisms, catalysts, and spectrophotometry.\nOxidation and reduction reactions power your phone and make it possible for your body to use the oxygen you inhale. We will learn about oxidation states (numbers), oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, galvanic/voltaic cells, electrolytic cells, cell potentials, and how electrochemistry is related to thermodynamics and equilibrium. \nThermodynamics is the study of heat, \"thermo,\" and work, \"dynamics.\" We will be learning about energy transfer during chemical and physical changes, and how we can predict what kind of changes will occur. Concepts covered in this tutorial include the laws of thermodynamics, internal energy, heat, work, PV diagrams, enthalpy, Hess's law, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. \nWe can combine our knowledge of acids and bases, equilibrium, and neutralization reactions to understand buffers and titrations. Solubility equilibria will build on concepts from solubility, precipitation, and equilibrium. \nIn this section we will be talking about the basics of acids and bases and how acid-base chemistry is related to chemical equilibrium. We will cover acid and base definitions, pH, acid-base equilibria, acid-base properties of salts, and the pH of salt solutions. \nMany chemical reactions are reversible, and the forward and backward reactions can occur at the same time. When the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the backward reaction, we call that a dynamic equilibrium. We will learn how equilibrium can be described by the equilibrium constant K, and how different factors than can affect the chemical equilibrium. \nHave you ever wondered how some insects are able to \"skate\" on the surface of water? We will learn about how intermolecular forces make this possible. We will also cover liquids, solids, mixtures, and phase changes.\nProperties of gases can be modeled using some relatively simple equations, which we can relate to the behavior of individual gas molecules. We will learn about the ideal gas law, vapor pressure, partial pressure, and the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution. \nChemical bonds are the glue that hold molecules together. We will learn about the different kinds of bonds, ways chemists draw bonds and molecules, and how the type of chemical bonding affects the bulk properties of a material. We will cover electronegativity, Lewis dot structures, VSEPR, bond hybridization, and ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds. \nLearn how the periodic table organizes the known elements of our world. Check out our videos and exercises on atomic structure and properties and periodic trends.\nSo we know that all matter is made up of atoms, but what is an atom made out of? Chemists describe the structure of atoms using models. This section will cover the Bohr model, photoelectric effect, absorption and emission spectra, quantum numbers, and electron configurations. \nWe are now going to delve into the heart of chemistry.

In Grade 5, students deepen their knowledge through a more generalized understanding of the relationships between and among adjacent places on the place value chart, e.g., 1 tenth times any digit on the place value chart moves the digit one place value to the right (5.NBT.1).  Toward the module’s end, students apply these new understandings as they reason about and perform decimal operations through the hundredths place.\"  Eureka Math/EngageNY (c) 2015 GreatMinds.org\n","lang":1,"url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/sitemaps/math/5th-engage-ny","title":"5th grade (Eureka Math/EngageNY)","sourceId":"Khan Academy"},{"description":"\"In this module, students build their competencies in measurement as they relate multiplication to the conversion of measurement units.  Throughout the module, students explore multiple strategies for solving measurement problems involving unit conversion.\" Eureka Math/EngageNY (c) 2015 GreatMinds.org\n\"This module gives students their first opportunity to explore decimal numbers via their relationship to decimal fractions, expressing a given quantity in both fraction and decimal forms.  Utilizing the understanding of fractions developed throughout Module 5, students apply the same reasoning to decimal numbers, building a solid foundation for Grade 5 work with decimal operations. Previously referred to as whole numbers, all numbers written in the base-ten number system with place value units that are powers of 10 are henceforth referred to as decimal numbers, a set which now includes tenths and hundredths (e.g., 1, 15, 248, 0.3, 3.02, and 24.35).\" Eureka Math/EngageNY (c) 2015 GreatMinds.org\n\"In this module, students build on their Grade 3 work with unit fractions as they explore fraction equivalence and extend this understanding to mixed numbers.  This leads to the comparison of fractions and mixed numbers and the representation of both in a variety of models.  Benchmark fractions play an important part in students’ ability to generalize and reason about relative fraction and mixed number sizes.  Students then have the opportunity to apply what they know to be true for whole number operations to the new concepts of fraction and mixed number operations.\" Eureka Math/EngageNY (c) 2015 GreatMinds.org\n\"This module introduces points, lines, line segments, rays, and angles, as well as the relationships between them.  Students construct, recognize, and define these geometric objects before using their new knowledge and understanding to classify figures and solve problems.  With angle measure playing a key role in the work throughout the module, students learn how to create and measure angles, as well as how to create and solve equations to find unknown angle measures.  In these problems, where the unknown angle is represented by a letter, students explore both measuring the unknown angle with a protractor and reasoning through the solving of an equation.  This connection between the measurement tool and the numerical work lays an important foundation for success with middle-school geometry and algebra.  Through decomposition and composition activities, as well as an exploration of symmetry, students recognize specific attributes present in two-dimensional figures.  They further develop their understanding of these attributes as they classify two-dimensional figures.\" Eureka Math/EngageNY (c) 2015 GreatMinds.org\n\"In this module, students use place value understanding and visual representations to solve multiplication and division problems with multi-digit numbers.

To build flexible thinking about fractions, students are exposed to additional fractional units such as fifths, ninths, and tenths.\" Eureka Math/EngageNY (c) 2015 GreatMinds.org\n\"In this module, students explore area as an attribute of two-dimensional figures and relate it to their prior understandings of multiplication.  In Grade 2, students partitioned a rectangle into rows and columns of same-sized squares and found the total number by both counting and adding equal addends represented by the rows or columns (2.G.2, 2.OA.4).\" Eureka Math/EngageNY (c) 2015 GreatMinds.org\n\"This module builds directly on students’ work with multiplication and division in Module 1 .  At this point, Module 1 instruction coupled with fluency practice in Module 2 has students well on their way to meeting the Grade 3 fluency expectation for multiplying and dividing within 100 (3.OA.7).  Module 3 extends the study of factors from 2, 3, 4,  5, and 10 to include all units from  0 to 10 , as well as multiples of 10 within 100.  Similar to the organization of Module 1 , the introduction of new factors in Module 3 spreads across topics.  This allows students to build fluency with facts involving a particular unit before moving on.

In Topic A, students initially use repeated addition to find the total from a number of equal groups (2.OA.4).  As students notice patterns, they let go of longer addition sentences in favor of more efficient multiplication facts (3.OA.1).  Lessons in Topic A move students’ Grade 2 work with arrays and repeated addition a step further by developing skip-counting rows as a strategy for multiplication.  Arrays become a cornerstone of the module.  Students use the language of multiplication as they understand what factors are and differentiate between the size of groups and the number of groups within a given context.  In this module, the factors 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and  10 provide an entry point for moving into more difficult factors in later modules.\"  Eureka Math/EngageNY (c) 2015 GreatMinds.org\n","lang":1,"url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/sitemaps/math/3rd-engage-ny","title":"3rd grade (Eureka Math/EngageNY)","sourceId":"Khan Academy"},{"description":"","lang":1,"url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/sitemaps/math/8th-grade-illustrative-math","title":"8th grade (Illustrative Mathematics)","sourceId":"Khan Academy"},{"description":"","lang":1,"url":"https://www.khanacademy.org/sitemaps/math/7th-grade-illustrative-math","title":"7th grade (Illustrative Mathematics)","sourceId":"Khan Academy"},{"description":"In this unit, students learn to understand and use the terms “ratio,” “rate,” “equivalent ratios,” “per,” “at this rate,” “constant speed,” and “constant rate,” and to recognize when two ratios are or are not equivalent.
